    <p>This website is a <b>gateway</b> on the Internet highway where judges, officers, elders, heads, scribes, Israelites, and the foreigner who has joined themselves to Israel may assemble, and in good order obtain judgment for all who need it.
        </p>
        <p>
        Deut. 16:18-20 commands the nation of Israel to “Appoint judges and officers within all your gates, which יהוה your Elohim is giving you, to your tribes. And they shall judge the people with righteous right-ruling."
        </p>
        <p>
        "...giving gates... to your tribes..." - What does this mean?  That Elohim is giving the 12 tribes of Israel gates. What type of gates? The historical answer was that this type of gate was in the city wall. Cities in ancient Israel were surrounded by walls. Here, the judges, elders, and officers congregated to enact this commandment. They judged as local courts matters that they could handle. Matters too hard for them were referred to the priests in the Temple @ Jerusalem, and the next level of appeal was the High Priest himself who was to seek Elohim for guidance concerning the verdict.  
        </p>
        <p>
       Today, we no longer live in cities surrounded by walls. If an Israelite living in the Land or abroad needs judgment, where can they go? Sure, they can find other brothers and sisters to get counsel on the matter. But what about community matters that require actual action, rather than mere talk? 
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>I Pet.4:17</b> For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Deut. 18:21</b>
“Do not distort right-ruling. Do not show partiality, nor take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the righteous.
</p>
<p>
“Follow righteousness, righteousness alone, so that you live and inherit the land which יהוה your Elohim is giving you. "</p>
</p>
    <p>
        Ideally, an Israelite should be able to go to a local assembly of elders who are equipped to judge matters amongst believers. However, I have noticed that many brothers and sisters do not have easy access to an in-person assembly. Yet most of these Israelites have access to the internet, or at least a phone. This makes prayer, counsel, assembly, and more possible, and has been a blessing to many on their Walk. 
        </p>
        <p>
    Enter the "All Your Gates" website.  It has become clear to many of us that technology has created a host of new gateways: access points on the information highway where traffic and assembly can and does occur. It can be a blessing if used well, and a potential security issue if left unsecure.  
    </p>
    <p>
        To leave unsecured these online gateways where Israelites assembly is the height of folly. Those seeking to subvert our Way have manipulated online groups and call-in groups. Hackers and identity theives have sought to undermine insecure religious websites and groups using the manipulation of trust. Those who are against us have tried to subvert our fellowships. Additionally, the bonds between individuals in these fellowship/prayer/study/counsel groups is often tenous and shaky because there is no supplementary communication systems devised other than impromptu, spur of the moment contact, calls, and email. However, applications like Zoom have streamlined the process and given control to he who moderates the Zoom meeting. Yet the problem that we still face is that each indiviual room is moderated by one person (usually), giving them total control, yes, but little accountability.  Breakout rooms have been devised to allow continued fellowship after the large-group meetings where more unmoderated fellowship can. This is needed. So, there are some good foundations here that need improving and Scriptural implementaion.

        We would do well to remember that the Kingdom government of Israel is no slip-shod affair.  Scriptures that pertain to it are abundant. We'll take a look a few: 
       </p>
        <p>
13 And it came to be, on the next day, that Mosheh sat to rightly rule the people. And the people stood before Mosheh from morning until evening.
</p>
        <p>
14 And when the father-in-law of Mosheh saw all that he did for the people, he said, “What is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit by yourself, and all the people stand before you from morning until evening?”
</p>
        <p>
15 And Mosheh said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to seek Elohim.
</p>
        <p>
16 “When they have a matter, they come to me, and I rightly rule between one and another, and make known the laws of Elohim and His Torot.”
</p>
        <p>
17 And the father-in-law of Mosheh said to him, “What you are doing is not good.
</p>
        <p>
18 “Both you and these people with you shall certainly wear yourselves out. For the matter is too heavy for you. You are not able to do it by yourself.
</p>
        <p>
19 “Now listen to my voice. Let me counsel you and Elohim be with you: Stand before Elohim for the people, and you shall bring the matters to Elohim.
</p>
        <p>
20 “And you shall enlighten them concerning the laws and the Torot, and show them the way in which they should walk and the work which they do.
</p>
        <p>
21 “But you yourself, seek out from all the people able men, who fear Elohim, men of truth, hating unfair gain. And place these over them to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
</p>
        <p>
22 “And they shall rightly rule the people at all times. And it shall be that they bring every great matter to you, but they themselves rightly rule every small matter. So, make it lighter for yourself, for they shall bear with you.
</p>
        <p>
23 “If you do this word, and Elohim shall command you, then you shall be able to stand and all this people also go to their place in peace.”
</p>
        <p>
24 And Mosheh listened to the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he said.
</p>
        <p>
25 And Mosheh chose able men out of all Yisra’ĕl, and made them heads over the people: rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
    </p>
        <p>

26 And they rightly ruled the people at all times – the hard matters they brought to Mosheh, but they rightly ruled every small matter themselves. 
    </p>
    <p>
       This Scripture shows us that Moses was overburdened trying to minister to and judge between way too many Israelites at once. On the other hand, there were capable individuals who could share the burden with Moses. As you re-read the passage above, note the qualifications that are required of the "heads": 
        <p>
    </p>
        “...seek out from all the people able men, who fear Elohim, men of truth, hating unfair gain. And place these over them to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens."
</p>
        <p> “And they shall rightly rule the people at all times. And it shall be that they bring every great matter to you, but they themselves rightly rule every small matter. So, make it lighter for yourself, for they shall bear with you.
</p>   
       </p>
        <p>
            So we see here that </p>
    <p> 1. There is a process of diligently seeking out qualified men for the task of judging between Israelites. </p>
    <p> 2. These individuals must have the following qualifications:
<p>a.) They must have ability/skill in matters of Torot.   </p>
b.)<p>They must be reverential of Elohim</p>
c.)They must be men of truth </p>
<p>d.) They must hate unfair gain/covetousness. This would include bribes or any partiality in judgment because of advantage.</p>
