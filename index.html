    <p>This website is a <b>gateway</b> on the Internet highway where judges, officers, elders, heads, scribes, Israelites, and the foreigner who has joined themselves to Israel may assemble, and in good order obtain judgment for all who need it.
        
        Deut. 16:18-20 commands the nation of Israel to “Appoint judges and officers within all your gates, which יהוה your Elohim is giving you, to your tribes. And they shall judge the people with righteous right-ruling."
        
        "...giving gates... to your tribes..." - What does this mean?  That Elohim is giving the 12 tribes of Israel gates. What type of gates? The historical answer was that this type of gate was in the city wall. Cities in ancient Israel were surrounded by walls. Here, the judges, elders, and officers congregated to enact this commandment. They judged as local courts matters that they could handle. Matters too hard for them were referred to the priests in the Temple @ Jerusalem, and the next level of appeal was the High Priest himself who was to seek Elohim for guidance concerning the verdict.  
        
       Today, we no longer live in cities surrounded by walls. If an Israelite living in the Land or abroad needs judgment, where can they go? Sure, they can find other brothers and sisters to get counsel on the matter. But was about community matters that require actual action, rather than mere talk? 
        
        <b>I Pet.4:17</b> For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God
        
        <b>Deut. 18:21</b>
“Do not distort right-ruling. Do not show partiality, nor take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the righteous.

“Follow righteousness, righteousness alone, so that you live and inherit the land which יהוה your Elohim is giving you. "</p>
